# Netsuite Transformation dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/))
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
- Produces modeled tables that leverage Netsuite data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/netsuite) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/netsuite#schemainformation) and builds off the output of our [Netsuite source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite_source).
- Enables users to insights into their netsuite data that can be used for financial statement reporting and deeper transactional analysis. This is achieved by the following:
    - Recreating both the balance sheet and income statement
    - Recreating commonly used data by using the transaction lines as the base table and joining other data
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled Netsuite data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/).

The following table provides a detailed list of all models materialized within this package by default. 
> TIP: See more details about these models in the package's [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/#!/overview?g_v=1&g_e=seeds).

| **Model**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [netsuite__transaction_details](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/#!/model/model.netsuite.netsuite__transaction_details) or [netsuite2__transaction_details](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/#!/model/model.netsuite.netsuite2__transaction_details)             | All transactions with the associated accounting period, account and subsidiary information. Where applicable, you can also see data about the customer, location, item, vendor, and department. |
| [netsuite__income_statement](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/#!/model/model.netsuite.netsuite__income_statement) or [netsuite2__income_statement](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/#!/model/model.netsuite.netsuite2__income_statement)             | All transaction lines necessary to generate an income statement (converted for the appropriate exchange rate of the parent subsidiary). Department, class, and location information are included for additional reporting functionality. |
| [netsuite__balance_sheet](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/#!/model/model.netsuite.netsuite__balance_sheet) or [netsuite2__balance_sheet](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_netsuite/#!/model/model.netsuite.netsuite2__balance_sheet)            | All transaction lines necessary to generate a balance sheet (converted for the appropriate exchange rate of the parent subsidiary). Non balance sheet transactions are categorized as either Retained Earnings or Net Income. |


# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have At least either one Fivetran **Netsuite** (netsuite.com) or **Netsuite2** (netsuite2) connector syncing the respective tables to your destination:
### Netsuite.com
- accounts
- accounting_periods
- accounting_books
- consolidated_exchange_rates
- currencies
- customers
- classes
- departments
- expense_accounts
- income_accounts
- items
- locations
- partners
- transaction_lines
- transactions
- subsidiaries
- vendors
- vendor_types

### Netsuite2
- account
- accounttype
- accountingbooksubsidiary
- accountingperiodfiscalcalendar
- accountingperiod
- accountingbook
- consolidatedexchangerate
- currency
- customer
- classification
- department
- entity
- entityaddress
- item
- item
- job
- location
- locationmainaddress
- transactionaccountingline
- transactionline
- transaction
- subsidiary
- vendor
- vendorcategory

### Database Compatibility
This package is compatible with either a **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, or **PostgreSQL** destination.

## Step 2: Install the package
Include the following netsuite package version in your `packages.yml` file:
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/netsuite
    version: [">=0.6.0", "<0.7.0"]
```
## Step 3: Define Netsuite.com or Netsuite2 Source
As of April 2022 Fivetran made available a new Netsuite connector which leverages the Netsuite2 endpoint opposed to the original Netsuite.com endpoint. This package is designed to run for either or, not both. By default the `netsuite_data_model` variable for this package is set to the original `netsuite` value which runs the netsuite.com version of the package. If you would like to run the package on Netsuite2 data, you may adjust the `netsuite_data_model` variable to run the `netsuite2` version of the package.
```yml
vars:
    netsuite_data_model: netsuite2 #netsuite by default
```

## Step 4: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `netsuite` schema. If this is not where your Netsuite data is (for example, if your netsuite schema is named `netsuite_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    netsuite_database: your_destination_name
    netsuite_schema: your_schema_name 
```

## (Optional) Step 5: Additional configurations

### Passing Through Additional Fields
This package includes all source columns defined in the macros folder. To add additional columns to this package, do so by adding our pass-through column variables to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    accounts_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "new_custom_field"
          alias: "custom_field"
    classes_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "this_field"
    departments_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "unique_string_field"
          alias: "field_id"
          transform_sql: "cast(field_id as string)"
    transactions_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "that_field"
    transaction_lines_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "other_id"
          alias: "another_id"
          transform_sql: "cast(another_id as int64)"
    customers_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "customer_custom_field"
          alias: "customer_field"
    locations_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "location_custom_field"
    subsidiaries_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "sub_field"
          alias: "subsidiary_field"
    consolidated_exchange_rates_pass_through_columns: 
        - name: "consolidate_this_field"
```

### Passing Through Transaction Detail Fields
Additionally, this package allows users to pass columns from the `netsuite__transaction_details` table into
the `netsuite__balance_sheet` and `netsuite__income_statement` tables. See below for an example
of how to passthrough transaction detail columns into the respective balance sheet and income statement final tables
within your `dbt_project.yml` file.

```yml
vars:
    balance_sheet_transaction_detail_columns: ['company_name','vendor_name']
    income_statement_transaction_detail_columns: ['is_account_intercompany','location_name']
```

### Change the build schema
By default, this package builds the Netsuite staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_netsuite_source`) and your Netsuite modeling models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_netsuite`) in your destination. If this is not where you would like your Netsuite data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    netsuite_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
    netsuite:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
    
### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:

> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
vars:
    # For all Netsuite source tables
    netsuite_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 

    # For all Netsuite2 source tables
    netsuite2_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```

## (Optional) Step 5: Orchestrate your models with Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core™

    description: >
      (Step 1/4) In order to accurately recreate the balance sheet and income statement, 
      it is necessary to convert all transaction amounts into the parent subsidiary currency. 
      The logic gets complicated because of balance sheet behavior. On the balance sheet, 
      the conversion rate you use for a single transaction will differ by accounting period.  
      For example, if a transaction took place in August, and you are generating 
      balances for the December period, you will need to convert the August transaction 
      using December's conversion rate.

      So we created a mapping of all accounting periods and the respective
      exchange rates, by subsidiary, naming it period_exchange_rate_map.

      Next, we cross join the accounts table to the period_exchange_rate_map,
      generating a map of exchange rates, by account, accounting period, and subsidiary.

      NOTE: This is only applicable if you're using exchange rates. Consult the README on how to 
      disable exchange rates using the `netsuite2__using_exchange_rate` in your dbt_project.yml.
  
  - name: int_netsuite2__tran_lines_w_accounting_period
    description: >
      (Step 2/4) Next, we need to prepare a cleaned version of all transactions we need.  
      Using the transactions and transaction_lines tables, the necessary fields are extracted, 
      and transactions that are deleted, revenue arrangements, or non-posting transactions are 
      filtered out. This is called transaction_lines_w_accounting_period. 
    
  - name: int_netsuite2__tran_and_reporting_periods
    description: >
      (Step 3/4) Once we have the cleaned transaction_lines_w_accounting_periods, we now need to figure out
      which exchange rate we should use for the currency conversion.  The balance sheet complicates 
      things, as conversion rates vary based on the reporting period.  Therefore, all transactions 
      need to be converted not only for the period in which the transaction took place in, but also 
      all subsequent periods. transaction_and_reporting_periods creates the necessary mapping for this.

  - name: int_netsuite2__tran_with_converted_amounts
    description: >
      (Step 4/4) Now that we have the exchange rates and the unconverted amounts, the next step is 
      to calculate the converted total. Additionally, we add in a couple of extra fields that will 
      help us in our final balance sheet and income statement queries.
            
      Note: This is only applicable if you're using exchange rates. See the README for instructions
      on how to disable exchange rates using the `netsuite2__using_exchange_rate` in your dbt_project.yml.

  - name: netsuite2__balance_sheet
    description: >
      The balance sheet query uses the transactions_with_converted_amount
      transformation to recreate all lines necessary for the balance sheet.
      Transactions that are not balance sheet transactions are categorized as
      either Retained Earnings or Net Income.  The Cumulative Translation
      Adjustment total, which in most cases does not have transactions
      associated with it, is calculated manually in the second part of the query.
